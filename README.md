# Stream Chat Flutter Audio Attachment

This repository demonstrates how to send audio attachments with [Stream Chat Flutter](https://getstream.io/chat/sdk/flutter/).

See the [written tutorial](https://getstream.io/blog/instantly-send-audio-messages-with-stream-chat-and-flutter/) for instructions.

## Getting Started

If you would like to run this repository yourself, replace the `streamKey` in `config.dart` with your Stream Chat application key.
This demo uses a project with Stream Chat authentication turned off.
